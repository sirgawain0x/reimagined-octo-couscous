- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling in all hooks
- [x] Add user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed canister calls
- [ ] Add timeout handling for long-running operations
- [x] Log errors to monitoring service (not console) - logger implemented, ready for Sentry integration

### 5. Configuration & Environment
- [x] Create `.env.example` file with all required variables
- [x] Add environment variable validation on startup
- [ ] Configure production canister IDs (requires deployment)
- [x] Set up proper network configuration for production
- [x] Add environment-specific build configurations
- [ ] Validate all canister IDs are set before deployment

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all React hooks
- [ ] Write unit tests for all service functions
- [ ] Write integration tests for canister interactions
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Add tests for error scenarios
- [ ] Set up CI/CD with automated testing
- [ ] Achieve minimum 80% code coverage

### 7. Canister Implementation
- [x] Complete cross-canister calls in portfolio canister
- [x] Implement actual balance lookups in portfolio canister
- [ ] Complete ckBTC balance checks in swap canister (placeholder - needs ckBTC ledger integration)
- [ ] Implement ckBTC address generation in swap canister (placeholder - needs ckBTC minter integration)
- [ ] Complete ckBTC withdrawal in swap canister (placeholder - needs ckBTC minter integration)
- [x] Add proper state persistence for all canisters (using persistent actors)
- [ ] Implement canister upgrade procedures (requires testing)

## Important (Should Fix Soon)

### 8. Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting for routes/components
- [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (remove unused dependencies)
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize canister query/update call patterns

### 9. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Set up error tracking service (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)
- [ ] Add analytics for user interactions
- [ ] Implement canister metrics collection
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create alerts for critical errors

### 10. Documentation
- [ ] Add API documentation for all canister methods
- [ ] Document all environment variables

- [ ] Configure automated code formatting
- [ ] Set up development environment documentation
- [ ] Add debugging tools/utilities
- [ ] Create developer setup script

## Current Status Summary

**Production Readiness: ⚠️ NOT READY - Significant Progress Made**

**Completion Estimate:**
- Critical Issues: ~65% complete (up from 20%)
- Overall: ~55% complete (up from 40%)

**Estimated Time to Production:**
- With focused effort: 1-2 weeks (reduced from 2-4 weeks)
- With part-time effort: 3-4 weeks (reduced from 6-8 weeks)

**Completed Items:**
✅ Frontend-backend integration (all hooks connected to canisters)
✅ Removed all console.log/console.error (replaced with logger)
✅ Admin authentication implemented (rewards & lending canisters)
✅ Error boundaries added (error.tsx, global-error.tsx)
✅ Cross-canister calls in portfolio canister
✅ .env.example file created
✅ Comprehensive error handling in all hooks
✅ Loading states for all async operations

**Remaining Blockers:**
1. ⚠️ Bitcoin integration incomplete (address generation, transactions, UTXO management)
2. ⚠️ No test coverage (unit, integration, E2E tests)
3. ⚠️ Input validation incomplete (canister-level validation needed)
4. ⚠️ Retry logic and timeout handling for canister calls
5. ⚠️ Rate limiting on canister methods
6. ⚠️ ckBTC integration incomplete (swap canister)

**Recommendation:**
Significant progress has been made on critical items. The application is now ~65% ready for production. Remaining work focuses on:
1. Bitcoin integration (core feature)
2. Testing infrastructure
3. Security hardening (rate limiting, input validation)
4. ckBTC integration

The application can be deployed to a test/staging environment for further validation, but production deployment should wait until Bitcoin integration and basic test coverage are complete.
