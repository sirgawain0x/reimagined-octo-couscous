- [ ] Log errors to monitoring service (not console)

### 5. Configuration & Environment
- [ ] Create `.env.example` file with all required variables
- [ ] Add environment variable validation on startup
- [ ] Configure production canister IDs
- [ ] Set up proper network configuration for production
- [ ] Add environment-specific build configurations
- [ ] Validate all canister IDs are set before deployment

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all React hooks
- [ ] Write unit tests for all service functions
- [ ] Write integration tests for canister interactions
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Add tests for error scenarios
- [ ] Set up CI/CD with automated testing
- [ ] Achieve minimum 80% code coverage

### 7. Canister Implementation
- [ ] Complete cross-canister calls in portfolio canister
- [ ] Implement actual balance lookups in portfolio canister
- [ ] Complete ckBTC balance checks in swap canister
- [ ] Implement ckBTC address generation in swap canister
- [ ] Complete ckBTC withdrawal in swap canister
- [ ] Add proper state persistence for all canisters
- [ ] Implement canister upgrade procedures

## Important (Should Fix Soon)

### 8. Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting for routes/components
- [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (remove unused dependencies)
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize canister query/update call patterns

### 9. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Set up error tracking service (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)
- [ ] Add analytics for user interactions
- [ ] Implement canister metrics collection
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create alerts for critical errors

### 10. Documentation

- [ ] Configure automated code formatting
- [ ] Set up development environment documentation
- [ ] Add debugging tools/utilities
- [ ] Create developer setup script

## Current Status Summary

**Production Readiness: ⚠️ NOT READY**

**Completion Estimate:**
- Critical Issues: ~20% complete
- Overall: ~40% complete

**Estimated Time to Production:**
- With focused effort: 2-4 weeks
- With part-time effort: 6-8 weeks

**Blockers:**
1. Frontend-backend integration (mock data)
2. Bitcoin integration incomplete
3. No test coverage
4. Security hardening needed

**Recommendation:**
Do not deploy to production until all critical issues are resolved. Start with frontend-backend integration and Bitcoin implementation, as these are the core functionality of the application.
