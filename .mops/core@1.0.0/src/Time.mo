/// System time utilities and timers.

/// The following example illustrates using the system time:
///
/// ```motoko
/// import Int = "mo:core/Int";
/// import Time = "mo:core/Time";
///
/// persistent actor {
///   var lastTime = Time.now();
///
///   public func greet(name : Text) : async Text {
///     let now = Time.now();
///     let elapsedSeconds = (now - lastTime) / 1000_000_000;
///     lastTime := now;
///     return "Hello, " # name # "!" #
///       " I was last called " # Int.toText(elapsedSeconds) # " seconds ago";
///    };
/// };
/// ```
///
/// Note: If `moc` is invoked with `-no-timer`, the importing will fail.
/// Note: The resolution of the timers is in the order of the block rate,
///       so durations should be chosen well above that. For frequent
///       canister wake-ups the heartbeat mechanism should be considered.
