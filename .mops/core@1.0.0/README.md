# `core`

* ðŸ“¦ [Mops Package](https://mops.one/core)
* âœ¨ [Documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/core)

---

The `core` package is the official standard library for the [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko) programming language. 

This replaces the original `base` library, which is available [here](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base). 

An official [migration guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/base-core-migration) is available for upgrading projects from `base` to `core`.

## Quick Start

1. Install the [Mops](https://docs.mops.one/quick-start) package manager
2. Open a terminal in your project directory
3. Run `mops add core`

This adds the following dependency to your `mops.toml` config file:

```toml
[dependencies]
core = "1.0.0"
```
